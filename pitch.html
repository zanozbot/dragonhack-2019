<p>We have created a responsive web app designed to save our users money on their electricity bill by predicting electricity costs. </p>

<p>By checking current and future weather we can predict any excess energy in the power grid and prompt our user to charge at the right times. Thus saving our user money and unloading the grid at the same time.</p>

<p>But we can take this a step further. With the invention of smarter and smarter devices, this process can easily be automated for a seamless user experience.</p>

<p>An example would be a smart car. I plug it in at 4 pm when I get home from work and have it charged by the next morning. Total charge time needed would be 4 hours. Our model would automatically assign four of the most appropriate hours and charge the car at those exact times. </p>

<p>The same can be done for your washing machines, dryers, water heaters and countless other smart devices.</p>

<p>GreenGo. Save energy, save money.</p>
