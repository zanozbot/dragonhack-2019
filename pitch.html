<p><b>Electricity prices are rising</b>. In the last decade alone, the prices went up for almost 20%. And they are expected to go even higher. At the same time, people use <b>more and more electric devices</b></p>

<p>We have created a <b>solution</b> designed to save our users money on their electricity bill by <b>predicting electricity costs.</b> </p>

<p>This is most useful for countries like <b>Austria, where the cost of electricity is already calculated by the hour.</b></p>

<p>This is done by teaching a <b>Keras hybrid neural network</b> using past data on the epex energy stock exchange and weather data.</p>

<p>By checking current and future weather we can predict any <b>excess energy in the power grid</b> and prompt our user to charge their devices at those times. Thus <b>saving our user money and unloading the grid</b> at the same time.</p>

<p>But we can take this a step further. With the invention of smarter and smarter devices, this process can easily be <b>automated for a seamless user experience.</b></p>

<p><b>An example would be a smart car.</b> I plug it in at 4 pm when I get home from work and want it charged by the next morning. Total charge time needed would be 4 hours. Our model would automatically assign four of the most appropriate hours and charge the car at those exact times. </p>

<p>The same can be done for your <b>washing machines, dryers, water heaters</b> and countless other smart devices.</p>
