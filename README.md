## About

Electricity prices are rising. In the last decade alone, the prices went up for almost 20%. And they are expected to go even higher. At the same time, people use more and more electric devices.

We have created a solution designed to save our users money on their electricity bill by predicting electricity costs.
This is most useful for countries like Austria, where the cost of electricity is already calculated by the hour.

This is done by teaching a Keras hybrid neural network using past data on the EPEX energy stock exchange and weather data.
By checking current and future weather we can predict any excess energy in the power grid and prompt our users to charge their devices at those times. Thus saving our user money and unloading the grid at the same time.

But we can take this a step further. With the invention of smarter and smarter devices, this process can easily be automated for seamless user experience.

An example would be a smart car. I plug it in at 4 pm when I get home from work and want it charged by the next morning. The total charge time needed would be 4 hours. Our model would automatically assign four of the most appropriate hours and charge the car at those exact times.
The same can be done for your washing machines, dryers, water heaters, and countless other smart devices.

GreenGo. Save energy, save money.
